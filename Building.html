        <h1>Building a Workstation</h1>
        <p>I am interested in computer builds because I was always interested in building my own PC with parts and I really like watching other YouTubers on how build their PCs</p>
        <p>I just began from watching videos but I was inspired because I had to learn about it for one of my high school projects</p>
        <p>My friend inspired me because he built his own PC</p>
        <p>I just really want to build a PC so I can have my own workstation</p>
